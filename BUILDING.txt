The software needs to be built using CMake, and it is strongly recommended to use a separate build directory:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

The software can then be run directly from the build tree, or packages generated using CPack.

See docs/guide/Logger-Hardware.md for more details.
