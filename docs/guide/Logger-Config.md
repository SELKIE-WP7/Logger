## Configuration {#LoggerConfig}

All of the configuration for the software is contained within an INI style text file that the software reads at start up.
This defines both the sources of data that will be recorded and the destination for the recorded data.

Configuration options within the file can be split into two categories:
* \subpage LoggerConfigCore "Core options" which control the behaviour of the software itself, and
* \subpage LoggerConfigSources "Source definitions" which define and configure the data sources to be used.
