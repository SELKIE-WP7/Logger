## Hardware {#LoggerHardware}

The data logging software has been developed to run on Linux systems, and can be run on typical desktop or laptop devices, or on smaller embedded systems such as the Raspberry Pi family of devices.
Of the latter, most testing has been carried out using Raspberry Pi 4 boards, with a number of different peripherals.

Examples of specific hardware data sources is given later in this guide under [supported devices and sources](@ref SupportedSources), but includes GPS receivers, networked devices, and a number of analog interface options.
