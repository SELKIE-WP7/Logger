# Logger User Guide{#Logger}
The `Logger` command is is the core of the data logging system, responsible for reading data from the various sources and recording it to disk.

The logging software processes information from a series of different **sources**. These represent devices or groups of devices providing information that needs to be recorded.
Each data source provides a number of different **channels** - some of these are defined by the logging software and allow sources and channels to provide configuration information or feedback, while the remainder are source specific.
Data is received from each source as **messages** containing the source and channel ID number as well as one or more values to be stored.
Groups of these messages are separated by **timestamps**, establishing the relative ordering of events and the precision to which the timing of events can be reconstructed later.

See [Core concepts](@ref LoggerConcepts) for more technical details and examples of how these concepts are used in practice.

See also the [Programs and Utilities](@ref programs) list, which includes links to documentation for individual tools where available.

Further information is given in \subpage LoggerTechDetails "Technical Details", as well as in the broader API documentation.

The general layout of the codebase is described in [code structure and layout](@ref CodeGroups), which provides a good starting point for the API and developer documentation.
Understanding the software at that level of detail not required to set up or use the logging software, but would be required to add support for new devices or analysis software.
