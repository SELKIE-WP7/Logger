# Logger User Guide{#Logger}
The `Logger` command is is the core of the data logging system, responsible for reading data from the various sources and recording it to disk.

This software has been developed as part of the [SELKIE project](https://www.selkie-project.eu/tools/wp7/), with the specific aim of providing a low-cost data recording solution.

Information can be recorded from a range of sources, including devices such as GPS receivers and accelerometers. Sources can also include existing communication networks with support for recording information from NMEA networks.

Each source of data then generates values for one or more measurement channels, with each value being recorded alongside the source and channel ID for later analysis.

This guide is split into several sections:

- \subpage LoggerConcepts "Core concepts" - introduces the terminology used and the general operation of the software
- \subpage LoggerHardware "Hardware and Installation" - explains some of the hardware used during testing and how the software can be installed.
- \subpage LoggerConfig "Configuration" - details the configuration file format and acts as the reference guide for individual source set up.
- \subpage LoggerFiles "File Formats" - describes the files generated by the software and how they are encoded.
- [Data processing](@ref DataProcGuide) - walks through an example of processing data after recording and discusses some of the alternative options.

See also the [Programs and Utilities](@ref programs) list, which includes links to documentation for individual tools where available.


The general layout of the codebase is described in [code structure and layout](@ref CodeGroups), which provides a good starting point for the API and developer documentation.
Further information is given in \subpage LoggerTechDetails "Technical Details", as well as in the broader API documentation.
Understanding the software at that level of detail not required to set up or use the logging software, but would be required to add support for new devices or analysis software.
