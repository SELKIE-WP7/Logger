 * The protocol used for data transmission requires each message to be tagged
 * with a source ID, that should be unique on any given system
 *
 * Source IDs range from 0 to 127, but are best represented as two digit
 * hexadecimal numbers, with the first number indicating a device or sensor
 * type and the second digit free to be used as a local device ID. In current
 * implementations these IDs are baked into device software or firmware, but
 * may be configurable for future devices.
 *
 * IDs in the 0x00 - 0x0F range are an exception, and each value represents a
 * different software source type.
 *
 * Any ID number or range not allocated here is considered reserved, although
 * software should still process data with unknown source ID numbers by
 * default.

 * @addtogroup loggerChannels Logger Channel IDs

 *
 * The protocol used for data transmission requires each message to be tagged
 * with a channel and source ID. While source IDs are required to be unique on
 * a given system, some channel numbers are common to all sources.
 *
 * As with source IDs, channel IDs range between 0 and 127. The mandatory
 * channels are described here, with the remaining numbers available for use as
 * required by any given source.
 *
 * The three log message types would not normally be included in a sources
 * channel map, but are available for use by any device.
